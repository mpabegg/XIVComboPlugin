  "Changelog": "1.4.1.0:
* Black Mage Fire/Blizzard Switch Feature added.
* Extensive Paladin changes. Some new features, some changed ones, a lot of removed ones.

1.4.1.2:
* Paladin Confiteor Feature returned (but it works differently and much more simply).
* Paladin Royal Authority to Holy Spirit Feature added.

1.4.1.6:
* Dropping Atonement is now no longer considered a damage gain. Therefore, Royal Authority to Atonement is back on the menu.

1.4.1.8:
* Royal Authority to Holy Spirit decoupled from combo (still works with it, of course).
* Shield Lob to Holy Spirit added.
* Fight or Flight to Requiescat added.

If a recent change isn't documented on this changelog, it is because it doesn't affect plugin functionality, or is a minor bugfix.",
